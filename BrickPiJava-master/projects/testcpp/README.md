TestCV
===========

CPP sample project for testing OpenCV from C++. The project is written in Eclipse C++ IDE and assumes the user is using CentOS. A tutorial for setting up an Linux dev environment is here http://electronsfree.blogspot.com/2015/03/opencv-eclipse-cdt-tutorial.html

Once you have the IDE setup, import the project and you should be ready to play with the code.
